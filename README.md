[TOC]

​	Adversarial attack is becoming a hot research area. However there are not easy to deep understand it. Now reading paper is the best way to understand adversarial attack. There's actually been a lot of papers on it. In this repositorie I will recommend some papers about different areas of adversarial attack. 

## Attack about object detectors

- [ ] Exploring the vulnerability of single shot module in object detectors via imperceptible background patches.

- [ ] Dpatch: An adversarial patch attack on object detectors.

## Augmentation to make attack robust

​	Different from the digital world, the attack will be disable caused by viewing angle, brightness, rotation, and so on.So there are many aumentation to make attack robust in the real world.
